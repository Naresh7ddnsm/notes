Install Angular

Step 01: Install Angular CLI
_____________________________
Install angular CLI throught Node Package Manager (NPM) by using below command line 

npm install @angular/cli -g (Or) npm i @angular/cli

Step 02: Create New Workspace
_____________________________
Angular cli offers you a simple way to creare a new project by using below command Line.

ng new my-app 

Angular CLI Prompts you for the information about the feature to include in the initial phase. 
So we can choose the option as per the development requirement.

STEP 03: RUN the application
______________________________

Angular includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.
By run below command line will build your app and open the browser auto.

ng serve --open (-o), --open will open your app in browser.


Template syntax:
_________________
Angular's template syntax extends HTML and JavaScript.
Ex:
<div *ngFor="let product of products">
</div>

Common Names:
1. Any directive with an asterisk, *, is a structural directive (*ngIf, *ngFor, ...)
2. interpolation syntax  - {{ }}
3. property binding syntax - [ ] 
4. Event binding syntax - ( ) set of parentheses


Interpolation {{ }} lets you render the property value as text; property binding [ ] lets you use the property value in a template expression.


@Input: Passes data from parent to child 
_________________________________________

Import Input from @angular/core.

The @Input() decorator indicates that the property value passes in from the component's parent

In the Parent component, pass the value whatever it type as property binding.

If parent has object below

let product = {
	"name": "Product",
	"id": "2"
}

<app-product-alerts [product]="product"> </app-product-alerts>

Here app-product-alerts is a child component and this component is declared in parent component. we are going to use the @Input decorator in the child component.



Difference between Constructor and ngOnInit
______________________________________________

Mostly we use ngOnInit for all the initialization/declaration and avoid stuff to work in the constructor. The constructor should only be used to initialize class members but shouldn't do actual "work".

So you should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection and not much else. ngOnInit() is better place to "start" - it's where/when components' bindings are resolved.
